For help/syntax, type: python wardrive.py -h

NOTE: Make a directory called "data" in the same directory as the Python script wardrive.py; I was too lazy to write all of the directory checking and creation, etc...
 
A new wardrive session is dumped to a file in ./data/ with a random suffix to keep from clobbering old files.

Requires gpsd installation
